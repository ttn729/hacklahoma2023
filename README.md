## Inspiration
We both love the thrill of gambling, so we built a web application where we could gamble to our hearts' content. 

## What it does
Users are able to start a game session with a number of tokens, and they are able to place their bets on six different cards. The user is then able to roll three dice, and depending on the roll, they will either gain or lose tokens.

## How we built it
For user authentication, we used Auth0, and for storing user information like the number of tokens they had on hand, we used MongoDB. For the frontend, we used React and the Material UI library; for the backend and dealing with routing/pages, we used NextJS.

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into some issues with build errors while working on the project; there were also some issues that cropped up with Git and dealing with merge conflicts and branching. The both of us had different experience levels with regards to web development and the technologies/frameworks used, which was a hurdle.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
First, we managed to finish the project. Secondly, we learned a lot regarding web development, dealing with the frontend, backend, and the connection between the two, as well as working with user authentication and databases.

## What we learned
We learned about React, how to use it, and concepts like useEffect hooks. We also learned a lot about web development in general: dealing with databases, user authentication, the connecting the frontend with the backend.

## What's next for The Hack Strikes Back: Gambling
In the future, we would like to try to implement multiplayer capability.
